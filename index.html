            Mathematics is designed to challenge and inspire students in the MST
            Program at West Humber Collegiate Institute. It offers a
            comprehensive curriculum that goes above and beyond the standard
            curriculum. Students in Grades 9 and 10 learn and tackle many math
            concepts that will help them in their future studies. Students in
            Grades 11 and 12 take special math courses as well as AP courses
            such as AP Calculus. This math course encourages critical thinking
            and problem-solving, preparing students for success.

            Science in the MST Program is designed to ensure students have a
            thorough understanding of a variety of topics. Students in grades 9
            to 10 are introduced to various scientific principles. By Grades 11
            and 12, science will be divided into different branches, allowing
            students to pursue the course of their choice (Biology, Chemistry,
            etc.). In addition, the MST program offers AP science courses in
            Grade 12.

            Technology is one of the program's shining Jewels. The MST program
            teaches students about the current technological world as well as
            how to code and be good digital citizens. Beginning in Grade 10, MST
            students will study computer science, by coding in Python. MST
            students begin programming classes a year earlier than usual, which
            can help to develop and foster an interest in the field.
